# CSS and Themes

There are some basic methods you should know:

1. Dimensions layout of the views *must* be set in the structure 
   files for each layout and view (i.e. not done via CSS files):
   * `layout.page_width` in `px` or `%` (e.g. `"height":"1000px"` 
      or `"height":"95%"`)
   * `layout.rows.height` in `px` (e.g. `"height":"600px"`)
   * `layout.rows.cols.width` in `px` or `%`
   * `layout.rows.cols.rows.height` in `px`
   * ... and so on
   * buut: since v1.0 you can change width and heigth using CSS
2. Every single view can have a `"decor"` setting, 
   to define a frame (divs with background images) and 
   also different CSS classes. 
   The `"decor"` can be defined on on the layout level to apply
   it on views, if the view has no `"decor"` defined.
   There are currently two decors build in:
   * `"decor":"decor"` with rounded white and gray borders 
   * `"decor":"tedge"` rounded half transparent borders
   * If no decor or theme is defined at all, just DIVs are arranged
3. CSS files:
   * Framework CSS default files are loaded first.
   * If you define a `"theme":"themename"` on the layout level of 
     the page, the page will try to load `css-custom/<themename>.css`. 
   * The last CSS file is the `css-custom/custom.css`. 
     You can place all your modifications here. 
   * If a smart phone is detected, it tries to load `css-custom/custom-m.css`
   * If a tablet browser is detected, it tries to load `css-custom/custom-t.css`

# Responsive Desing for Mobile Phone and Tablet Support   
In the `index.html` a viewport is defined, so CSS for responsive design is prepared.
The custom.css defines some pattern, you should look at to start your desing.

The framework additionally tries to detect mobile phones or tablets. 
By this, you have the option to replace the whole GUI layout and CSS for 
phones and tablets.

If the framework detects a mobile phone:

1. The page will try use the layout structure `<name>-m/structure` 
2. The page will try to load `css-custom/custom-m.css` 
    
If the framework detects a tablet device:

1. The page will try use the layout structure `<name>-t/structure` 
2. The page will try to load `css-custom/custom-t.css` 


Optimize the `structure` for mobile design assuming a HTML page width of `980px`:

    {
      "layout": { 
        "title": "New Portal", 
        "page_width": "980px", 
        ... 
      } 
      ... 
    }

# Caching Cheat

Caching is annoying, if you work on CSS or structure files. 
To avoid caching you can append a `nc=true`as query parameter to the URL.
I.e. all CSS files will equippted with a random query parameter, so your 
browser will not cache them.
